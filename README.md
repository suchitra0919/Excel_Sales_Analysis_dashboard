# Excel_Sales_Analysis_dashboard

Challenge: 
 Our current sales data is stored in a raw format, making it difficult for our business owner to quickly and visually grasp key trends and performance metrics. 
 This lack of readily available insights hinders our ability to make informed decisions about sales strategies, product offerings, and resource allocation.

Objective: 
 By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, we aim to create a comprehensive sales dashboard that provides the business owner with a clear,
 real-time view of sales performance. This dashboard will empower them to:

1. Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) at a glance
2. Identify sales trends and patterns
3. Drill down into specific sales data

Expected Outcome: 
 With this interactive sales dashboard, the business owner will gain a deeper understanding of sales performance, leading to better decision-making,
 improved resource allocation, and ultimately, increased revenue and customer satisfaction.
